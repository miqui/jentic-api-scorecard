# Jentic API Scorecard

An OpenAPI document that passes validation isn't necessarily one an AI agent can use. Grammar is
one thing; semantic clarity, safety, and discoverability are another. The **Jentic API Scorecard**
scores your OpenAPI document against the
[Jentic API AI Readiness Framework (JAIRF)](https://github.com/jentic/api-ai-readiness-framework)
across six dimensions and returns a single grade — so you know exactly where to improve.

## What it scores

Each OpenAPI document is evaluated across six lenses — small, targeted improvements in any of them
tend to produce outsized gains for both human developers and AI agents:

- **Foundational Compliance (FC)** — structural validity and conformance to OpenAPI itself.
- **Developer Experience & Jentic Compatibility (DXJ)** — documentation quality and how well the
  OpenAPI document plays with downstream tooling.
- **AI-Readiness & Agent Experience (ARAX)** — semantic clarity and the context an LLM needs to
  reason about each operation.
- **Agent Usability (AU)** — predictable, safe multi-step orchestration.
- **Security (SEC)** — declared auth schemes and trust boundaries.
- **AI Discoverability (AID)** — how easily an AI system can find and parse the OpenAPI document.

## How it works

Scoring runs locally inside a Docker container in two phases. **Analysis** runs a battery of
validators and structural checks against the OpenAPI document to produce a set of diagnostics and
observations.
**Scoring** maps those into ~35 signals across the six JAIRF dimensions, aggregates them into
per-dimension scores, and rolls those up into a single weighted score and grade.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 20.10.0 with npm/npx. See [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Docker** installed and running. See [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  The CLI pulls the scoring image automatically on first run.
- Network access to [`ghcr.io`](https://ghcr.io) (to pull the image) and to whatever URL hosts the
  OpenAPI document you're scoring (the engine fetches it from inside the container).

## Try it now

OpenAPI documents from [Jentic Public APIs (OAK)](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis)
score without any key or limit — no signup, no config:

```bash
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis/refs/heads/main/apis/openapi/swagger-api/petstore/1.0.27/openapi.json
```

For URLs outside OAK or local files, set the API key:

```bash
JENTIC_API_KEY=mvp-preview npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score \
  https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

```bash
JENTIC_API_KEY=mvp-preview npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score ./openapi.yaml
```

That's it. The CLI pulls the scoring engine automatically on first run.

## Control output depth

The `--detail` flag lets you zoom in:

```bash
# Just the headline score and grade
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score --detail summary ./openapi.yaml

# Per-dimension breakdown (default)
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score --detail dimensions ./openapi.yaml

# Individual signals within each dimension
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score --detail signals ./openapi.yaml

# Full diagnostics with top 5 findings per severity
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha score --detail diagnostics ./openapi.yaml
```

## Anonymous vs keyed access

OpenAPI documents from [Jentic Public APIs (OAK)](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis)
score without any key. For everything else, set the MVP preview key:

```bash
export JENTIC_API_KEY=mvp-preview
```

This is a documented public placeholder for the alpha preview — not a secret. Real key issuance
arrives in a future release.

## Supply-chain attestations

Each `@jentic/api-scorecard-cli` alpha release ships with two independent
[Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)-signed attestations bound to the published tarball's
SHA-256 digest. Both are produced inside the GitHub Actions release workflow (no human
keyholder, no long-lived secrets) and are verifiable with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
≥ 2.49.

| Attestation | Predicate type | What it claims | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **npm provenance** | `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1` | Where and how the tarball was built (workflow run, commit SHA, builder identity) | npm registry record + GitHub attestations index |
| **SPDX SBOM** | `https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3` | The runtime dependency closure of the published tarball, in [SPDX 2.3](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/) form | GitHub attestations index |

Both attestations are present from **`1.0.0-alpha.11`** onward; earlier alphas have provenance
only (the SBOM attestation pipeline reached parity with the registry-served bytes in alpha.11).

### Verify a release

```bash
# 1. Download the published tarball
npm pack @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@alpha

# 2. Verify the npm provenance (gh's default predicate type)
gh attestation verify ./jentic-api-scorecard-cli-*.tgz --owner jentic

# 3. Verify the SPDX SBOM (non-default predicate type, must be requested explicitly)
gh attestation verify ./jentic-api-scorecard-cli-*.tgz --owner jentic \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3
```

Each successful run reports `Loaded digest sha256:…` and lists the matched attestation.

### Download the SBOM

`gh attestation verify` proves authenticity but doesn't print the SPDX document itself. The
SBOM is embedded as the `predicate` of the verified in-toto statement; extract it with
`--format json` and pipe through `jq`:

```bash
gh attestation verify ./jentic-api-scorecard-cli-*.tgz --owner jentic \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3 \
  --format json \
  | jq '.[0].verificationResult.statement.predicate' \
  > sbom.spdx.json
```

`sbom.spdx.json` is a complete SPDX 2.3 document — the document root carries the published
package's purl (`pkg:npm/@jentic/api-scorecard-cli@<version>`) and the `packages` array
enumerates every runtime dependency with its exact resolved version. Feed it directly to any
SPDX-aware tool ([Trivy](https://trivy.dev/), [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype),
[OSV-Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner)).

Tying download to verification is deliberate: the recipe above succeeds only if the signature
checks out, so you never end up with bytes that didn't pass the trust check.

## Status

This project is in **alpha**. Track progress in
[`specs/roadmap.md`](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/specs/roadmap.md).

The `:unstable` Docker image is rebuilt on every push to `main` for direct `docker run` users.
Versioned images are published alongside each alpha CLI release.
